A Minecraft Server implementation and API to surpass them all!

This is a new Minecraft Server that will allow more customization compared to the average server, such as modifiable Online & Max Player Counts, fireable Packets that can be accessed form anywhere, allowing multiple versions to connect, and a Plugin API!

Features
--------
>> Modifiable ServerPing variables, such as Oline Player Count ('which is a string')
>> 1.7 through 1.8 can connect, lower versions won't be supported because of Netty Rewrite(?)
>> Plugin API that has access to all the features of the Server, essentially making it completely hackable.
